[4] Project Purpose (프로젝트 목적)

It is planned as a service to help improve irregularities in apartment management fees, improve the cleanliness of the apartment complex environment, and allow neighbors to handle waste sorting for busy modern people.

(아파트 관리비 비리 개선과 아파트 단지 환경을 깨끗하게 개선하고 바쁜 현대인을 위해 분리수거를 이웃주민이 대신 처리해줄 수 있게 도움을 주는 서비스로 기획)

[5] Planning Background (기획배경)

In order to prevent incidents and accidents that occur due to corruption in apartment management fees and lack of communication between residents, we provide a community that can provide relevant services and a web/service that can provide services in order to create an apartment complex with smoother communication between residents and a corruption-free apartment complex. I started planning an app.

(아파트 관리비에 대한 비리와 입주민간의 소통 부재로 인하여 벌어지는 사건사고를 막기 위해 보다 원활한 입주민간의 소통 및 비리없는 아파트 단지를 만들어보고자 해당 서비스를 제공할 수 있는 커뮤니티 및 서비스를 제공할 수 있는 웹/앱을 기획하게 됐습니다.)

[6] Purpose and expected results (목적 및 기대 효과)

Inter-floor noise and parking problems that frequently arise while living in an apartment can be solved by allowing free communication between residents, and the effect of being able to create a clean home and a clean apartment complex by separating and collecting waste in the house.

(아파트에 거주를 하면서 빈번히 발생되는 층간 소음, 주차문제 등을 입주민간의 자유로운 소통을 하게 됨으로써 해결해보고, 내 집안의 쓰레기들을 분리수거 함에 있어 깨끗한 내 집, 깨끗한 아파트 단지를 조성할 수 있게 되는 효과를 가져올 수 있습니다.)

[10] What I felt from the project (프로젝트에서 느낀점)

: As the project progressed, I took on the role of team leader, and I felt like my skills, which were lacking, had improved further. If I had just listened to the lecture, I would have missed some more details. It was a great opportunity to further improve my skills while studying. It was a moment when I realized once again that experience is the most important in any field!!! I felt that this project was a beginning, not an end. There is still a lot more studying left to do!!! Although it was difficult, there was a sense of joy that I felt every time I solved each problem. The most difficult part was that I was the least skilled among the team members, so I received a lot of help from my team members, but I also learned a lot from it. There were a lot. In fact, if I hadn't been the team leader, I might not have been able to complete this project. However, while working on this project, I found myself growing more, communication with team members was important no matter what project I was working on, and I became more relaxed(?) in dealing with errors.
